## Full Description

Design and implement a Marriott Reservation System for the hotel in New York city. Marriott has three types of rooms: a standard room that has one queen bed, a junior suite that has one queen bed and two sofas, and a luxury room that has one queen bed, two sofas, and an openable glass door. The standard room price is $150 per night. The junior suite price is $200 per night. The luxury room price is $240 per night. Marriott has 10 standard rooms, 6 junior suites, and 4 luxury rooms. This system should allow an agent to input a customer name, selected room type, arrival and departure dates. It should also provide the capability to calculate the total charge and display it on the screen.

number and total charge should be displayed.
